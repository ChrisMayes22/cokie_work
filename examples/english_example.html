    <p><center>[1]</center></p>
    <p> 
        Architect Paul Revere Williams open his own 
        firm in 1922, and his vision and willingness to experiment
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 1 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>led to</u> a successful fifty-year career of planning buildings,
        primarily near Los Angeles. <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 'letters_1' ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>[A]</u> He Helped create more
        than 3,000 buildings, <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 2 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>which varied in type,</u> as well as 
        homes for the Hollywood elite. However, Williams 
        did not limit his work to Southern California. His 
        architecture stretches from Washington, DC, to Bogot&aacute;,
        Colombia. One of his most interesting designs <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 3 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>were</u> 
        in Las <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 4 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>Vegas;</u> the La Concha Motel.
    </p>
    <p><center>[2]</center></p>
    <p>
        In 1961, Williams, by then a renowned architect,
        was hired to design a new 100-room motel. Situated 
        among larger Las Vegas hotels, the La Concha needed 
        to stand <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 5 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>out.</u> Williams was tasked with creating an 
        eye-catching design that would attract guests. He drew
        inspiration from a Southern California architectural
        trend known as Googie. <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 'letters_1' ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>[B]</u>
    </p>
    <p><center>[3]</center></p>  
    <p>
        Envisioning a motel that combined the
        name La Concha (which translates to "shell")
        with the arched roofs atypical of Googie architecture,
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 6 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>the lobby that Williams designed</u> was meant to
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 7 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>appear, from a distance like</u> a giant shell. On three 
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 8 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>of the ones,</u> Williams designed twenty-eight-foot-high 
        concrete arches that <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 9 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>jutted out</u> over the sidewalks. <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 'letters_1' ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>[C]</u>
        Inside, the <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 10 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>lobby, which was a place for gathering,</u>
        consisted of a large, open space that functioned as
        a social gathering <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 11 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>place, and included</u> the registration
        desk.
    </p>
    <p><center>[4]</center></p>
    <p>
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 12 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>Indeed</u> most of the La Concha Motel was torn down in 
        2005, the famous shell-like lobby lives on. <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 'letters_1' ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>[D]</u> Preservation 
        groups saved it from <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 13 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>demolition, and, in 2006,</u> the lobby 
        was moved across town in pieces. Reassembled, it became 
        the visitors' center of the Neon Museum, where retired
        neon signs are put on display <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 14 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>(the famous neon sign of 
        the cowboy names Vegas Vic was erected in 1951)</u> With 
        a distinctive design that enhances the Neon Museum, 
        Williams's lobby is one of the last remaining celebrated 
        examples of Googie architecture in the United States.

    <p><center><STRONG>For Octopuses, Play's the Thing</STRONG></center></p>
    <p>
        Often dismissed as aquatic oddities,
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 16 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>the octopus is part of a species that are</u> among
        the most intelligent animals on Earth. With the largest brains of any invertebrate,
        octopuses can solve complex problems. Researchers have documented octopuses 
        navigating intricate mazes and <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 17 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>octopuses even open</u>
        screw-top jars.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2012, at the New England Aquarium, an octopus used its anatomical siphon to propel a pill bottle
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 18 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>crossed its</u> tank. When the pill bottle
        reached the other side, a jet stream in the tank returned it to the octopus. Amazingly,
        the octopus propelled the pill bottle back toward the jet stream. The researchers at the aquarium realized the 
        octopus was doing something extraordinary: inventing a version of pitch-and-catch.
    </p>
    <p>
        In inventing this game, the <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 19 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>actions of the octopus were not based</u>
        on survival. The octopus simply wanted to play. Evolutionary biologists believe play could have an important role
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 20 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>through animals</u>
        cognitive development. According to the Theory of Flexibility,
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 21 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>play, the theory says,</u> teaches an
        animal to modify its <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 22 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>behaviors, helping</u>
        the animal prepare for unexpected situations.
    </p>
    <p>
        Embracing this idea, researchers at Cincinnati's Newport Aquarium have compiled an "Octopus Enrichment Handbook."
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 23 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>Crazy, right? Yet this</u> book
        provides in-depth descriptions of <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 24 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>toys and puzzles</u>
        researchers have invented for octopuses. One such puzzle is a series of nesting cubes. Each cube features a different
        latch <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 25 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>for</u> the octopus has to open until the 
        octopus reaches the smallest cube. <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 'deleted_text_1' ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>Typically, after just a few weeks, octopuses master this puzzle, 
            solving it in a matter of minutes.</u>
    </p>
    <p>
        Researchers are interested not only in whether octopuses can solve such puzzles 
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 27 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>but also</u> in the methods
        by which they do so. While one octopus might use trial-and-error to unlatch the cubes, another octopus
        may just <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 28 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>use a lot of strength in opening the larger cubes</u>
        to get to the smaller ones. <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 29 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>Therefore, researchers</u> have
        noted how octopuses modify and improve their methods over time,
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 30 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>suggesting that</u> play may indeed be a factor
        in an octopus's cognitive development.

    <p>
        In her sand animation <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 31 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>performances, artist Illana Yahav</u> tells
        stories through a series of images she creates by <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 32 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>operating</u>
        a layer of sand on a glass surface. She works on a glass tabletop that's brightly light from underneath,
        the scenes she forms projected onto a large screen in real time. <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 'letters_2' ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>[A]</u>
        Viewers must watch closely because each story Yahav tells cascades by in images that last just a second or two.
    </p>
    <p><center>[2]</center></p>
    <p>
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 33 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>To tell a story,</u> Yahav clears sand from the 
        center of the glass. As she shapes the sand around edges of this space, silhouettes of images, such as the 
        outline of a face, <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 34 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>appear.</u>
        She pinches sand onto the <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 35 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>glass to "draw" facial features, and other,</u> 
        small objects. When she wants to create less-defined <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 36 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>images, such as a grove of trees or a snowfall,</u> 
        she dusts sand onto the glass with lights shakes of her hand. <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 'letters_2' ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>[B]</u> 
        Yahav's hands move <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 37 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>fluidly; not pausing</u> while a
        story is being told.
    <p><center>[3]</center></p>
    <p>
        Scenes during Yahav's four-minute story "You've Got a Friend" <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 38 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>illustrates many</u> 
        of her techniques. Using just the side of her hand, Yahav transforms the image of an orange resting in an open palm to that of
        the face of a young woman, her head resting on her forearm. <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 'letters_2' ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>[C]</u> 
        Facial features, along with a  teardrop near one eye, appear when Yahav pinches bits of sand into place
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 39 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>on the face of a young woman.</u> A steady sweep
        of Yahav's <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 40 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>hand, then outlining</u>
        the silhouette of a second female <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 41 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>face</u> 
        on the right-hand edge of the glass. Next, Yahav uses smooth, winding motions with four fingers to great effect, 
        transforming the first woman's limp hair into curls. With one swipe of her index finger, Yahav smudges out the woman's tear. 
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 42 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>Still,</u> she flicks both hands to add 
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 43 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>at once</u> flowers to the woman's hair.

    <p><center>[4]</center></p>
    <p>
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 'letters_2' ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>[D]</u> Yahav plans and 
        memorizes every frame of her stories, outlining the scenes on a storyboard similar to the kind filmmakers use. 
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 44 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}><strong>[44]</strong></u> As she explains,

        I had to drag myself out of the bed to see the sunrise. Kayla had been insistent. And so there I was her
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 46 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>car, it being</u> 3:30 in the morning,
        equipped with a seldom-used hoodie and a giant thermos of coffee. "You'll need this at the top," she said. She handed me 
        a wool hat, which I regarded skeptically. We were in Maui, after all; we had spent the day before lying on the beach. 
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 47 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>Further,</u> I decided to take her word for it. 
        I had never been to the top of Mount Haleakala, the "House of the Sun." <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 'letters_3' ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>[A]</u>

        Supposedly, <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 48 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>a view of</u> the most beautiful 
        sunrise in the word from the summit of the dormant volcano, 10,023 feet above sea level. <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 'letters_3' ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>[B]</u> 
        Tourists and locals <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 49 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>alike make the arduous</u>
        38-mile drive, cheerfully navigating the hairpin turns in the dark hours of early morning. Kayla was one of them. I, on 
        the other hand, clutched my coffee and tried not to focus on the 
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 50 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>well-traveled road</u> before us.

    <p><center>[3]</center></p>

        Once we reached the summit and parked the car, my misgivings were compounded by the shocking 
        cold; <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 51 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>being,</u> at most, 40 degrees 
        Fahrenheit. <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 'letters_3' ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>[C]</u> I grudgingly 
        pulled on the wool hat, trudging behind Kayla until we reached the main observation point. About a hundred people had 
        already <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 52 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>gathered, a guard rail</u> the only 
        thing separating them from the crater's edge. Granted, all I could see were clouds. A thick lid of them foamed slowly over the crater,
        creating <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 53 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>what looked like the surface of another planet.</u> 
        It was strange to stand before such alien beauty and hear the familiar murmurs of chitchat and the casual slurps of coffee coming

        In 1797, Andr&eacute;-Jacques Garnerin caused a stir in Paris when, at an elevation of 3,200 feet, he detached the 
        basket he was riding in from its hot air balloon. Suspended under a twenty-three-foot-wide canopy of silk,
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 61 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>people were shocked as Garnerin</u> and his 
        basket floated to the ground. His stunt is widely regarded as the first <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 62 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>trial</u> 
        parachute jump. About three hundred years before Garnerin designed his 
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 63 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>parachute, however, Italians artist, Leonardo da Vinci,</u> 
        had sketched a similar contraption in the margins of a <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 64 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>notebook centuries before.</u> 
    </p>
    <p>
        Unlike the nylon parachutes of today, <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 66 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>these</u> bend as 
        they catch the air, Leonardo's design, if constructed, would be rigid and unwieldy; its frame consisted of twenty-two-foot-long 
        wooden poles shaped into a pyramid. It was unclear whether the linen panels anchored to the frame would catch enough air to 
        ensure a jumper's safe landing. 
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 'deleted_text_2' ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>Leonardo himself never actually built his parachute.</u>
    </p>
    <p>
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 'letters_4' ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>[B]</u> (1) In 2000, British skydiver 
        Adrian Nicholas decided to test Leonardo's design. <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 'letters_4' ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>[A]</u> (2) The finished parachute weighed 187 
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 68 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>pounds;</u> about 172 pounds heavier than a 
        modern parachute. (3) He constructed the parachute according to Leonardo's plans, using only materials that would have 
        been available in fifteenth-century Milan. <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 'letters_4' ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>[C]</u> 
        (4) Because of <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 69 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>it's</u> weight, Nicholas had to cut 
        himself free near the end of the <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 70 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>jump and deploy</u> 
        his backup parachute. (5) <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 71 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>Still,</u> he had proved 
        that Leonardo's pyramidal design could slow a parachutist's descent. <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 'letters_4' ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>[D]</u>
    </p>
    <p>
        Eight years later, Swiss parachutist Olivier Vietti-Teppa modernized Leonardo's original concept. His parachute was 
        constructed with nylon and without the heavy wooden frame. Despite his inability to steer the parachute, Vietti-Teppa 
        managed to complete what he called a perfect jump. <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 73 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}><strong>[73]</strong></u> 
        The pyramidal shape of the parachute allowed him to glide 
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 74 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>gracefully-and safely</u> to the ground.
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 75 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>Before long,</u> Leonardo's historic sketch had 
        become a modern reality.
