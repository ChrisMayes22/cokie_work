    <p> 
        The farmer, my new boss, handed me a 
        bucket <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 1 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>pointing</u> down a 
        long row. <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 2 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>“Scuppernongs are this way,” he said. 
        “Muscadines start two rows over.”</u>
    </p>
    <p>
        From a distance, the field had looked contained and orderly with its grapevines in 
        row upon tidy row, <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 3 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>they were all</u> the 
        same breadth and height and spaced the same distance apart. <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 4 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>or instance,</u> the scene was more 
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 5 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}> chaos, enchanting so.</u> Vines tangled 
        around each other, heart-shaped leaves reaching in all directions. 
        Clusters of grapes <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 6 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>
        drooped haphazardly.</u> The outer portions of the vines had already 
        been picked clean. <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 7 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>I could see other workers nearby.</u>
    </p>
    <p>
        Scuppernongs and muscadines—the words themselves so flavorful—<u className = {props.targetQuestion === 8 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>growing</u> wild in the southeastern 
        United States for centuries. <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 'letters_1' ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>[A]</u>
        Few farms cultivate <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 9 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>it</u> 
        commercially. <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 'letters_1' ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>[B]</u> <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 10 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>The grapes have a faintly musky flavor.</u> 
        They can be twice as big as the grapes more commonly sold in grocery 
        stores. <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 'letters_1' ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>[C]</u> 
        Instead of being oblong or egg-shaped, 
        they are almost perfectly spherical, something like marbles, only soft, and full of summer.
    </p>
    <p>
        Typically, commercial grapes can be cut from the vine a cluster at a time, because all the fruit in a cluster ripens 
        at the same time. A single cluster of scuppernongs or muscadines, however, may have two grapes ready to be picked 
        immediately, four that will be ready the following day, and a half dozen that won’t ripen until the following week. 
        Harvesting is, therefore, labor-intensive.
    </p>
    <p>
        Scuppernongs <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 11 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>make a transition 
        color-wise</u> from light 
        green to translucent yellow as they mature. 
        But when the <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 12 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>fruit,
        which grows in vineyards,</u> is deep in the vine, <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 13 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>so</u> 
        a vineyard worker can have a hard time seeing the color of the grapes. Following instructions from the farmer, I picked 
        by feel instead, testing the skin for the rubbery 
        texture that would indicate ripeness. After filling my <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 14 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>bucket to the brim,</u> I walked back to the shelter, 
        the harvest accumulating there on long wooden tables. 
        Resting a moment, I slipped a grape in my mouth, <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 15 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>spat</u> out the bitter seeds and skin, and let the sweet 
        fruit settle on my tongue.
