    <p><center>[1]</center></p>
    <p> 
        Architect Paul Revere Williams open his own 
        firm in 1922, and his vision and willingness to experiment
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 1 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>led to</u> a successful fifty-year career of planning buildings,
        primarily near Los Angeles. <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 'letters_1' ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>[A]</u> He Helped create more
        than 3,000 buildings, <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 2 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>which varied in type,</u> as well as 
        homes for the Hollywood elite. However, Williams 
        did not limit his work to Southern California. His 
        architecture stretches from Washington, DC, to Bogot&aacute;,
        Colombia. One of his most interesting designs <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 3 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>were</u> 
        in Las <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 4 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>Vegas;</u> the La Concha Motel.
    </p>
    <p><center>[2]</center></p>
    <p>
        In 1961, Williams, by then a renowned architect,
        was hired to design a new 100-room motel. Situated 
        among larger Las Vegas hotels, the La Concha needed 
        to stand <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 5 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>out.</u> Williams was tasked with creating an 
        eye-catching design that would attract guests. He drew
        inspiration from a Southern California architectural
        trend known as Googie. <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 'letters_1' ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>[B]</u>
    </p>
    <p><center>[3]</center></p>  
    <p>
        Envisioning a motel that combined the
        name La Concha (which translates to "shell")
        with the arched roofs atypical of Googie architecture,
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 6 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>the lobby that Williams designed</u> was meant to
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 7 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>appear, from a distance like</u> a giant shell. On three 
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 8 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>of the ones,</u> Williams designed twenty-eight-foot-high 
        concrete arches that <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 9 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>jutted out</u> over the sidewalks. <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 'letters_1' ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>[C]</u>
        Inside, the <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 10 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>lobby, which was a place for gathering,</u>
        consisted of a large, open space that functioned as
        a social gathering <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 11 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>place, and included</u> the registration
        desk.
    </p>
    <p><center>[4]</center></p>
    <p>
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 12 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>Indeed</u> most of the La Concha Motel was torn down in 
        2005, the famous shell-like lobby lives on. <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 'letters_1' ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>[D]</u> Preservation 
        groups saved it from <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 13 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>demolition, and, in 2006,</u> the lobby 
        was moved across town in pieces. Reassembled, it became 
        the visitors' center of the Neon Museum, where retired
        neon signs are put on display <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 14 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>(the famous neon sign of 
        the cowboy names Vegas Vic was erected in 1951)</u> With 
        a distinctive design that enhances the Neon Museum, 
        Williams's lobby is one of the last remaining celebrated 
        examples of Googie architecture in the United States.

    <p><center><STRONG>For Octopuses, Play's the Thing</STRONG></center></p>
    <p>
        Often dismissed as aquatic oddities,
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 16 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>the octopus is part of a species that are</u> among
        the most intelligent animals on Earth. With the largest brains of any invertebrate,
        octopuses can solve complex problems. Researchers have documented octopuses 
        navigating intricate mazes and <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 17 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>octopuses even open</u>
        screw-top jars.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2012, at the New England Aquarium, an octopus used its anatomical siphon to propel a pill bottle
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 18 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>crossed its</u> tank. When the pill bottle
        reached the other side, a jet stream in the tank returned it to the octopus. Amazingly,
        the octopus propelled the pill bottle back toward the jet stream. The researchers at the aquarium realized the 
        octopus was doing something extraordinary: inventing a version of pitch-and-catch.
    </p>
    <p>
        In inventing this game, the <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 19 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>actions of the octopus were not based</u>
        on survival. The octopus simply wanted to play. Evolutionary biologists believe play could have an important role
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 20 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>through animals</u>
        cognitive development. According to the Theory of Flexibility,
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 21 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>play, the theory says,</u> teaches an
        animal to modify its <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 22 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>behaviors, helping</u>
        the animal prepare for unexpected situations.
    </p>
    <p>
        Embracing this idea, researchers at Cincinnati's Newport Aquarium have compiled an "Octopus Enrichment Handbook."
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 23 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>Crazy, right? Yet this</u> book
        provides in-depth descriptions of <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 24 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>toys and puzzles</u>
        researchers have invented for octopuses. One such puzzle is a series of nesting cubes. Each cube features a different
        latch <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 25 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>for</u> the octopus has to open until the 
        octopus reaches the smallest cube. <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 'deleted_text_1' ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>Typically, after just a few weeks, octopuses master this puzzle, 
            solving it in a matter of minutes.</u>
    </p>
    <p>
        Researchers are interested not only in whether octopuses can solve such puzzles 
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 27 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>but also</u> in the methods
        by which they do so. While one octopus might use trial-and-error to unlatch the cubes, another octopus
        may just <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 28 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>use a lot of strength in opening the larger cubes</u>
        to get to the smaller ones. <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 29 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>Therefore, researchers</u> have
        noted how octopuses modify and improve their methods over time,
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 30 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>suggesting that</u> play may indeed be a factor
        in an octopus's cognitive development.

    <p>
        In her sand animation <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 31 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>performances, artist Illana Yahav</u> tells
        stories through a series of images she creates by <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 32 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>operating</u>
        a layer of sand on a glass surface. She works on a glass tabletop that's brightly light from underneath,
        the scenes she forms projected onto a large screen in real time. <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 'letters_2' ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>[A]</u>
        Viewers must watch closely because each story Yahav tells cascades by in images that last just a second or two.
    </p>
    <p><center>[2]</center></p>
    <p>
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 33 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>To tell a story,</u> Yahav clears sand from the 
        center of the glass. As she shapes the sand around edges of this space, silhouettes of images, such as the 
        outline of a face, <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 34 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>appear.</u>
        She pinches sand onto the <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 35 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>glass to "draw" facial features, and other,</u> 
        small objects. When she wants to create less-defined <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 36 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>images, such as a grove of trees or a snowfall,</u> 
        she dusts sand onto the glass with lights shakes of her hand. <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 'letters_2' ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>[B]</u> 
        Yahav's hands move <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 37 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>fluidly; not pausing</u> while a
        story is being told.
    <p><center>[3]</center></p>
    <p>
        Scenes during Yahav's four-minute story "You've Got a Friend" <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 38 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>illustrates many</u> 
        of her techniques. Using just the side of her hand, Yahav transforms the image of an orange resting in an open palm to that of
        the face of a young woman, her head resting on her forearm. <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 'letters_2' ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>[C]</u> 
        Facial features, along with a  teardrop near one eye, appear when Yahav pinches bits of sand into place
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 39 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>on the face of a young woman.</u> A steady sweep
        of Yahav's <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 40 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>hand, then outlining</u>
        the silhouette of a second female <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 41 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>face</u> 
        on the right-hand edge of the glass. Next, Yahav uses smooth, winding motions with four fingers to great effect, 
        transforming the first woman's limp hair into curls. With one swipe of her index finger, Yahav smudges out the woman's tear. 
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 42 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>Still,</u> she flicks both hands to add 
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 43 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>at once</u> flowers to the woman's hair.

        I had to drag myself out of the bed to see the sunrise. Kayla had been insistent. And so there I was her

        equipped with a seldom-used hoodie and a giant thermos of coffee. "You'll need this at the top," she said. She handed me 
        a wool hat, which I regarded skeptically. We were in Maui, after all; we had spent the day before lying on the beach. 
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 47 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>Further,</u> I decided to take her word for it.

        In 1797, Andr&eacute;-Jacques Garnerin caused a stir in Paris when, at an elevation of 3,200 feet, he detached the 
        basket he was riding in from its hot air balloon. Suspended under a twenty-three-foot-wide canopy of silk,
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 61 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>people were shocked as Garnerin</u> and his 
        basket floated to the ground. His stunt is widely regarded as the first <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 62 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>trial</u> 
        parachute jump. About three hundred years before Garnerin designed his 
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 63 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>parachute, however, Italians artist, Leonardo da Vinci,</u> 
        had sketched a similar contraption in the margins of a <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 64 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>notebook centuries before.</u> 
    </p>
    <p>
        Unlike the nylon parachutes of today, <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 66 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>these</u> bend as 
        they catch the air, Leonardo's design, if constructed, would be rigid and unwieldy; its frame consisted of twenty-two-foot-long 
        wooden poles shaped into a pyramid. It was unclear whether the linen panels anchored to the frame would catch enough air to 
        ensure a jumper's safe landing. 
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 'deleted_text_2' ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>Leonardo himself never actually built his parachute.</u>

        Adrian Nicholas decided to test Leonardo's design. <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 'letters_4' ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>[A]</u> (2) The finished parachute weighed 187 
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 68 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>pounds;</u> about 172 pounds heavier than a 
        modern parachute. (3) He constructed the parachute according to Leonardo's plans, using only materials that would have 
        been available in fifteenth-century Milan. <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 'letters_4' ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>[C]</u> 
        (4) Because of <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 69 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>it's</u> weight, Nicholas had to cut 
        himself free near the end of the <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 70 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>jump and deploy</u> 
        his backup parachute. (5) <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 71 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>Still,</u> he had proved

    </p>
    <p>
        Eight years later, Swiss parachutist Olivier Vietti-Teppa modernized Leonardo's original concept. His parachute was 
        constructed with nylon and without the heavy wooden frame. Despite his inability to steer the parachute, Vietti-Teppa 
        managed to complete what he called a perfect jump. <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 73 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}><strong>[73]</strong></u> 
        The pyramidal shape of the parachute allowed him to glide

    <p>
        In 1973 the three-year-old colt Secretariat won each event of the Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing 
        (the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness Stakes, and the Belmont Stakes), a feat accomplished only eleven times in the twentieth 
        century. While many actors contributed to Secretariat's success-selective breeding, top-notch trainers, and a skillful 
        jockey, to name a few-the expertise and diligent care of the horse's groom, Eddie <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 1 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>Sweat, who deserves</u> 
        some of the credit. <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 2 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}><strong>[2]</strong></u>
    </p>
    <p>
        Although often overlooked and underappreciated, a groom plays a significant role in the life of a racehorse. A groom's 
        basic tasks include washing and brushing the horse, trimming its mane and tail, and <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 3 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>they clean</u> 
        its hooves. <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 'letters_5' ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>[A]</u> <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 4 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>A groom also</u> 
        cleans stalls and takes care of riding equipment. <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 'letters_5' ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>[B]</u> Those
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 5 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>whom</u> witnessed Sweat with Secretariat 
        attest that his care surpassed the usual duties of a groom. He'd talk to the horse <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 6 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>constantly, he'd soothe</u> 
        him in Gullah, a Creole-English language commonly spoken in the South Carolina African American community Sweat grew up in.
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 'letters_5' ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>[C]</u> After cooking Secretariat a mash 
        of oats and corn, he'd watch him eat, taking note of any changes in appetite <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 7 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>noticeable to him while the horse was eating.</u> 
        He'd also examine Secretariat's teeth and take his temperature daily, <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 8 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>attention to</u> 
        any signs of illness or distress. <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 'letters_5' ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>[D]</u> 
        Sweat would spend extra time massaging the horse's legs, applying healing poultices made from herbs he had gathered.
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 9 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>However, on</u> nights before big races, he'd even 
        sleep next to the horse's stall. <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 10 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}><strong>[10]</strong></u>

    <p>
        Sweat's <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 11 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>constant, companionship,</u> and expert care 
        kept Secretariat healthy and calm in a stressful racing environment <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 12 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}><strong>[12]</strong></u>.

    <p>
        When <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 16 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>geologist, Elizabeth Catlos,</u> began 
        gathering garnets in the Himalayan Mountains in the late 1990s, most scientists had a fairly rigid understanding of the mountain
        range's history. <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 'letters_6' ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>[A]</u> It was commonly 
        held that the Himalayas had formed approximately 55 million years ago when <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 17 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>India drifted</u> 
        north on a layer of semimolton rock, collided with Asia. The collision <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 18 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>forced</u> 
        one tectonic plate into the other, crumpling the land where the plates met. The resulting mountain range, one of the longest in 
        the world, stretches 1,500 miles across six countries and <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 19 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>features many impressive mountains.</u> 
        Although the Himalayan range was thought to have remained relatively unchanged over these tens of millions of years, Catlos 
        was surprised to discover that some of the garnets she had collected formed <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 20 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>less than that many</u> 
        years ago. <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 'letters_6' ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>[B]</u>
    </p>
    <p><center>[2]</center></p>
    <p>
        Garnets are gemstones with a crystal structure. They are formed many mile beneath the surface of the earth, where high 
        pressures and temperatures <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 21 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>allows</u> them to 
        crystallize. These gemstones <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 22 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>are really good in</u> 
        geologic dating. <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 'letters_6' ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>[C]</u> <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 23 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>Resistant to</u> 
        chemical change after they crystallize, scientists can analyze the gemstones to determine the temperature and pressure of the 
        earth when the garnets formed. Such analyses are possible because garnets also monazite, 
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 24 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>a rare mineral that is easily dated.</u> This allows 
        scientists to identify the garnets' approximate <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 25 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>age. And</u> the

        The dating of Carlos's garnets, as well as analysis of the pressures and temperatures encoded in their structure, indicates that 
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 26 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>they</u> were not formed by a single collision, as 
        was previously thought. Rather, it seems that India has continued to push northward into Asia. According to new estimates, the 
        mountain range <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 27 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>as we know it</u> today most 
        likely underwent major changes as recently as five million years ago. Incredibly, as one of Catlos colleagues
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 28 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>notes,</u> "Geologically, the present 
        Himalayan range front was formed just yesterday." <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 'letters_6' ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>[D]</u>

    <p><center><strong>Ports of Recall: Hudson River Ferries</strong></center></p>
    <p>
        The first steam-powered ferry on the Hudson River, the <em>Juliana</em>, left Hoboken, New Jersey, for New York City on 
        October 11, 1811, <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 31 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>in the nineteenth century.</u> 
        Ferries, mostly of the small sailboat kind called sloops, had been traveling on the Hudson for centuries, carrying cargo and 
        passengers. What made steamboat travel so revolutionary was speed. A trip from New York City to Albany, for example, took 
        seven <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 32 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>days in a sloop,</u> a steamboat shortened 
        that trip <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 33 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>to one day.</u> Less vulnerable to the 
        weather, steam-powered ferries were reliable, and thus their popularity grew. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Onboard these ferries, commuters crossed from homes in <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 34 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>Hoboken to jobs</u> 
        in Manhattan Society's upper echelon meandered on scenic upriver excursions. "Passengers" sometimes included horses, goats, and 
        chickens. Many of these vessels offered rudimentary comforts at best. Others, <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 35 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>from that time period,</u> 
        boasted an elegance <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 36 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>that unsurpassed</u> the river. 
        For a while, older styles of ferries, such as those <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 37 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>powered</u> 
        by horses brought onboard to turn a paddle wheel, continued to operate. But the steam-powered ferries, hundreds of them, ruled 
        the Hudson River for most of the <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 38 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>nineteenth, and</u> 
        part of the twentieth centuries. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 39 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>Bear Mountain Bridge was built by the Harriman family.</u> 
        Until bridges spanned the Hudson River-more than a mile wide in <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 40 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>places,</u>
        car owners relied on ferries to transport their vehicles from one shore to another. Bearing names like <em>Elimira</em>, 
        <em>Lackawanna</em>, <em>Tuxedo</em>, and <em>Skillypot</em>, <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 41 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>ferry travel</u>
        helped transform the region into one of the biggest economic and cultural centers of the world. At  <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 42 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>its'</u>
        peak in 1927, ferry service between New Jersey <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 43 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>to</u> 
        New York reached twenty-seven million passengers annually. In a few years that number plummeted. The Hudson River Vehicular Tunnel, 
        later renamed the Holland Tunnel, opened in 1927, <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 44 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>followed by</u> 
        the George Washington Bridge in 1931. By the time the first cars traveled 1.5 miles through the Lincoln Tunnel in 1937, 
        the golden age of ferries on the Hudson had ended.

        [1] Crowdsourcing, "recruiting" volunteers from the general public to help perform a task, is often an efficient means of 
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 46 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>rummaging around</u> massive amounts of data. 
        [2] But for the Whale Song Project, which focuses on deciphering the songs of killer and pilot whales, crowdsourcing also alleviates 
        the problem of subjective interpretation. [3] It has been instrumental in classifying galaxies and decoding ancient papyri.
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 47 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}><strong>47</strong></u>
    </p>
    <p>
        The key to learning more about the meaning of whale <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 48 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>songs, scientists believe, is</u> 
        to study the songs in context. Their aim is to establish what type of situation elicits a particular song. Two pieces of sophisticated 
        recording equipment <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 49 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>is</u> essential in this endeavor:
        D-tags and hydrophone arrays. <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 50 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>For example,</u> D-tags 
        are noninvasive devices temporarily attached to the whales with suction cups. Hydrophone arrays are webs of underwater recording 
        devices <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 51 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}><strong>[51]</strong></u>. Using this equipment, 
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 52 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>scientists have amassed roughly 15,000 songs,</u> 
        along with other background noises and data about the whales' locations and movements.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now scientists are turning to crowdsourcing to meet the next <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 53 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>challenge:</u> tagging
        similar-sounding songs as matches. These matches are vital for the <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 54 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>project,</u> 
        they allow scientists to identify and compare multiple situations in which the same song was recorded. The 
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 55 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>process, which effectively narrows</u> the range of 
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 56 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>potential factors that possibly could have</u> 
        evoked a particular song, thereby offering better clues to the song's meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
        The variability <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 57 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>in</u> human capacity to distinguish 
        high and low tones makes the matching process highly subjective. Crowdsourcing, however, allows scientists to 
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 58 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>nab</u> significant trends in matchmaking rather than 
        to work from a few listeners' interpretations. <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 59 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>Nevertheless,</u>
        songs can be sorted more reliably. Where so much depends on identifying similarities in <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 60 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>sounds that</u>
        crowdsourcing could provide a crucial step toward understanding what the whales are saying.

        [1] When silent comedy <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 61 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>films, which debuted</u> 
        in the early 1900s, the public was delighted by slapstick's over-the-top brawls, falls, and pantomimes. [2] Exaggerated 
        gestures and expressions, long used by actors to hammer home the hilarity of their acts in vaudeville theaters, began to fall 
        flat with filmgoers. [3] By 1910, however, <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 62 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>audiences' tastes were</u> 
        more refined. [4] <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 63 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>Craving comedies, but they lamented</u> 
        the overacting, audiences began to call for <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 64 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>funnier-and more natural-</u>
        silent actors. <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 65 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}><strong>[65]</strong></u>
    </p>
    <p>
        An illustrator's model, Mabel Normand, proved perfect for the part. Skilled at calling up realistic emotions for magazine art and ads,
        Normand was invited to take part in a film as an extra. <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 66 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>After impressing them</u> 
        with her natural wit and nuanced expressions, directors at the Biograph film company offered her a costar's contract. 
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 67 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>Within a year, she was accepting starring roles with major studios.</u>
    </p>
    <p>
        Normand livened up their usual comedy fare, radiating charisma <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 67 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>in case</u> 
        she was waltzing at a garden party or tumbling into a mud puddle. Audiences, starstruck, wrote in to newspapers asking who this new 
        talent was. Actors, too, were inspired by Normand's lively but subtle comedy style. One of her costars, the young Charlie Chaplin, 
        later attributed part of his immense success to Normand's mentoring.
    </p>
    <p>
        Normand set an example not only for her costars, but <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 69 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>also for</u>
        women entering film. Early comedies cast women in only a handful of stereotypical <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 70 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>parts, such as,</u>
        the dutiful daughter or the damsel in distress. As Normand's fame increased and she began to write and direct her own films, she 
        created new heroines to better <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 71 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>suit</u> her daring 
        spirit. <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 72 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}><strong>[72]</strong></u> What's more, they 
        have the last laugh. After getting hit with a pie in the film <em>The Ragtime Band</em>, <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 73 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>however,</u> 
        Normand's character, outraged, wipes the pie off her face and flings it right back. Her initiative sets off a massive food 
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 74 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>fight, throughout which</u> nobody laughs 
        harder than Normand.
