    <p style="text-indent:40px"> 
        Architect Paul Revere Williams open his own 
        firm in 1922, and his vision and willingness to experiment
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 1 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>led to</u> a successful fifty-year career of planning buildings,
        primarily near Los Angeles. <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 'letters_1' ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>[A]</u> He Helped create more
        than 3,000 buildings, <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 2 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>which varied in type,</u> as well as 
        homes for the Hollywood elite. However, Williams 
        did not limit his work to Southern California. His 
        architecture stretches from Washington, DC, to Bogot&aacute;,
        Colombia. One of his most interesting designs <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 3 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>were</u> 
        in Las <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 4 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>Vegas;</u> the La Concha Motel.
    </p>
    <p><center>[2]</center></p>
    <p style="text-indent:40px">
        In 1961, Williams, by then a renowned architect,
        was hired to design a new 100-room motel. Situated 
        among larger Las Vegas hotels, the La Concha needed 
        to stand <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 5 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>out.</u> Williams was tasked with creating an 
        eye-catching design that would attract guests. He drew
        inspiration from a Southern California architectural
        trend known as Googie. <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 'letters_1' ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>[B]</u>
    </p>
    <p><center>[3]</center></p>  
    <p style="text-indent:40px">
        Envisioning a motel that combined the
        name La Concha (which translates to "shell")
        with the arched roofs atypical of Googie architecture,
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 6 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>the lobby that Williams designed</u> was meant to
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 7 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>appear, from a distance like</u> a giant shell. On three 
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 8 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>of the ones,</u> Williams designed twenty-eight-foot-high 
        concrete arches that <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 9 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>jutted out</u> over the sidewalks. <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 'letters_1' ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>[C]</u>
        Inside, the <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 10 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>lobby, which was a place for gathering,</u>
        consisted of a large, open space that functioned as
        a social gathering <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 11 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>place, and included</u> the registration
        desk.

        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 12 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>Indeed</u> most of the La Concha Motel was torn down in 
        2005, the famous shell-like lobby lives on. <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 'letters_1' ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>[D]</u> Preservation 
        groups saved it from <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 13 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>demolition, and, in 2006,</u> the lobby 
        was moved across town in pieces. Reassembled, it became 
        the visitors' center of the Neon Museum, where retired
        neon signs are put on display <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 14 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>(the famous neon sign of 
        the cowboy names Vegas Vic was erected in 1951)</u> With 
        a distinctive design that enhances the Neon Museum, 
        Williams's lobby is one of the last remaining celebrated 
        examples of Googie architecture in the United States.

    <p><center><STRONG>For Octopuses, Play's the Thing</STRONG></center></p>
    <p style="text-indent:40px">
        Often dismissed as aquatic oddities,
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 16 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>the octopus is part of a species that are</u> among
        the most intelligent animals on Earth. With the largest brains of any invertebrate,
        octopuses can solve complex problems. Researchers have documented octopuses 
        navigating intricate mazes and <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 17 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>octopuses even open</u>
        screw-top jars.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent:40px">
        In 2012, at the New England Aquarium, an octopus used its anatomical siphon to propel a pill bottle
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 18 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>crossed its</u> tank. When the pill bottle
        reached the other side, a jet stream in the tank returned it to the octopus. Amazingly,
        the octopus propelled the pill bottle back toward the jet stream. The researchers at the aquarium realized the 
        octopus was doing something extraordinary: inventing a version of pitch-and-catch.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent:40px">
        In inventing this game, the <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 19 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>actions of the octopus were not based</u>
        on survival. The octopus simply wanted to play. Evolutionary biologists believe play could have an important role
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 20 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>through animals</u>
        cognitive development. According to the Theory of Flexibility,
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 21 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>play, the theory says,</u> teaches an
        animal to modify its <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 22 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>behaviors, helping</u>
        the animal prepare for unexpected situations.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent:40px">
        Embracing this idea, researchers at Cincinnati's Newport Aquarium have compiled an "Octopus Enrichment Handbook."
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 23 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>Crazy, right? Yet this</u> book
        provides in-depth descriptions of <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 24 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>toys and puzzles</u>
        researchers have invented for octopuses. One such puzzle is a series of nesting cubes. Each cube features a different
        latch <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 25 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>for</u> the octopus has to open until the 
        octopus reaches the smallest cube. <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 'deleted_text_1' ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>Typically, after just a few weeks, octopuses master this puzzle, 
            solving it in a matter of minutes.</u>
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent:40px">
        Researchers are interested not only in whether octopuses can solve such puzzles 
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 27 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>but also</u> in the methods
        by which they do so. While one octopus might use trial-and-error to unlatch the cubes, another octopus
        may just <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 28 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>use a lot of strength in opening the larger cubes</u>
        to get to the smaller ones. <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 29 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>Therefore, researchers</u> have
        noted how octopuses modify and improve their methods over time,
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 30 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>suggesting that</u> play may indeed be a factor
        in an octopus's cognitive development.

    <p style="text-indent:40px">
        The first steam-powered ferry on the Hudson River, the <em>Juliana</em>, left Hoboken, New Jersey, for New York City on

        Ferries, mostly of the small sailboat kind called sloops, had been traveling on the Hudson for centuries, carrying cargo and 
        passengers. What made steamboat travel so revolutionary was speed. A trip from New York City to Albany, for example, took 
        seven <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 32 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>days in a sloop,</u> a steamboat shortened 
        that trip <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 33 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>to one day.</u> Less vulnerable to the 
        weather, steam-powered ferries were reliable, and thus their popularity grew.

        For a while, older styles of ferries, such as those <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 37 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>powered</u> 
        by horses brought onboard to turn a paddle wheel, continued to operate. But the steam-powered ferries, hundreds of them, ruled

    <p style="text-indent:40px">
        The fog-shrouded mountains surrounding Asheville frequently lured Masa, with heavy, unwieldy camera equipment in tow, out of 
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 53 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>the studio he'd opened in Asheville.</u> Morning 
        hikes became weeks-long expeditions. To get the perfect shot, Masa would scale the highest mountains, <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 54 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>lugging</u> 
        his equipment on his back. He sometimes waited hours for the clouds to arrange themselves to his liking before he took a picture.

    <p style="text-indent:40px">
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 55 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>Masa's measuring instruments were innovative.</u> 
        Using an odometer mounted on the detached front end of a bicycle, Masa measured his routes. He pushed the contraption across the 
        steep terrain, hiking and measuring, measuring and hiking, year after year. From these measurements, he produced detailed maps.

        Masa made it his mission to ensure that the land he treasured would be preserved as a national park. He gave his photos and 
        maps to prominent Asheville visitors, recruiting First Lady Grace Coolidge and wealthy philanthropist John D. Rockefeller Jr., 
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 56 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>among others,</u> to join the park campaign.
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 57 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>In reality,</u> to build support from the wider public, 
        Masa distributed thousands of postcards of his photos.

        Great Smoky Mountains National Park was established in 1934, a year after Masa's death. Although not many park visitors climb

    <p><center><strong>Cozy Graffiti</strong></center></p>
    <p style="text-indent:40px">
        In 2005, Houston shop owner Magda Sayeg knit a blue-and-pink cozy, or fitted cover, for the street-side door handle of her store. 
        It was a slow day; Sayeg was bored. To her surprise, the seemingly out-of-place little cosy drew a lot of attention and often made people smile.
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 61 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>Inspired by the effects, Sayeg</u> knit a leg warmer for the 
        stop sign on the corner. This time, drivers actually pulled over for a closer look. Some people even took pictures of the sign. 
        As Sayeg expanded her territory around Houston, her then-anonymous projects gained notoriety online and in newspapers, sparking 
        similar endeavors by knitters and crocheters around the globe.

    <p style="text-indent:40px">
        Adopting the <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 62 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>utterances</u> of graffiti, these yarn 
        artists commonly refer to the act of covering something with knitted or crocheted yarn <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 63 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>such as</u> 
        "tagging." They take measurements of an object they wish to cover, stitch at home, and then quietly wrap the object during the night. 
        <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 64 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>Rather, in</u> the morning, a park full of trees wrapped 
        in striped leg warmers welcomes joggers. Giant metal chain links on a wharf appear <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 65 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>covered in</u> 
        violet, green, white, blue. Sidewalk <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 66 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>cracks being</u> 
        filled with skinny, knitted ropes of magenta.

    <p style="text-indent:40px">
        Some yarn graffiti <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 67 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>artists mainly want</u> to surprise 
        people, offering a bit of homey comfort where <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 68 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>we're</u> 
        least expected. Others, however, aim for a more political message, <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 69 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>they drape</u> 
        cannons and tanks in colorful crocheted afghans. In 2011, <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 70 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>knitter Jessie Hammons</u> 
        decided she'd had enough of people snapping pictures of the bronze statue of Rocky (a fictional boxer) in front of the Philadelphia 
        Museum of Art without ever going inside the <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 71 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>museum.</u> 
        She crafted a bright pink hoodie for the muscular <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 72 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>figure, who was played by Sylvestor Stallone in the <em>Rocky</em> movies.</u>

    <p style="text-indent:40px">
        Although yarn tagging is a form of graffiti, <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 73 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>it's tolerated more often than</u> 
        other forms because the yarn can be simply snipped off. This may be the aspect that allows people to smile as they drop coins 
        into a cozy, purple parking meter and to consider the artist's <u className = {props.targetQuestion === 74 ? classes.targetQuestion : []}>sweet&ndash;or edgy</u> point.
