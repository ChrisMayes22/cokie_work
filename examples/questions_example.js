        <div>Suppose the writer's primary purpose had been to explain the way Boyd's photographs were used to 
            make maps of the east coast of Greenland. Would this essay accomplish that purpose?

    <span>A.  Yes, because the writer hints that because Boyd had studied photogrammetry, she deliberately created 
        photographs that could be used to make maps.
    </span>,
    <span>B.  Yes, because the writer makes clear that Boyd had photographed a region that, before her expeditions, 
        had not been thoroughly documented.
    </span>,
    <span>C.  No, because although the writer mentions that Boyd's photographs were used to make maps, the writer does not 
        elaborate on how this was done.
    </span>,
    <span>D.  No, because the writer instead focuses on describing how Boyd positioned her camera to create 
        high-resolution images of glaciers.
