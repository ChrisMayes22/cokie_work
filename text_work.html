<p><strong>Passage I</strong></p>
<p><STRONG>LITERARY NARRATIVE:</STRONG> This passage is adapted from the 
    book <em>Braiding Sweetgrass: Indigenous Wisdom, Scientific
    Knowledge, and the Teachings of Plants</em> by Robin Wall 
    Kimmerer (©2013 by Robin Wall Kimmerer).</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">Even now, after more than fifty Strawberry Moons,
    finding a patch of wild strawberries still touches me
    with a sensation of surprise, a feeling of unworthiness
    and gratitude for the generosity and kindness that
    comes with an unexpected gift all wrapped in red and
    green. "Really? For me? Oh, you shouldn't have." After
    fifty years they still raise the question of how to 
    respond to their generosity. Sometimes it feels like
    a silly question with a very simple answer: eat them.</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">But I know that someone else has wondered these
    same things. In our Creation stories the origin of staw-
    berries is important. Skywoman's beautiful daughter,
    whom she carried in her womb from Skyworld, grew on
    the good green earth, loving and loved by all the other
    beings. But tragedy befell her when she died giving 
    birth to her twins, Flint and Sapling. Heartbroken, Sky-
    woman buried her beloved daughter in the earth. Her
    final gifts, our most revered plants, grew from her body.
    The strawberry arose from her heart. In Potawatomi, the
    strawberry is <em>ode min,</em> the heart berry. We recognize
    them as the leaders of the berries, the first to bear fruit.</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">Strawberries first shaped my view of a world full
    of gifts simply scattered at your feet. A gift comes to
    you through no action of your own, free, having moved
    toward you without your beckoning. It is not a reward;
    you cannot earn it, or call it to you, or even deserve it.
    And yet it appears. Your only role is to be open-eyed
    and present. Gifts exist in a realm of humility and 
    mystery-as with random acts of kindness, we do not
    know their source.</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">Those fields of my childhood showered us with
    strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, hickory nuts in
    the fall, bouquets of wildflowers brought to my mom,
    and family walks on Sunday afternoon. They were our
    playground, retreat, wildlife sanctuary, and ecology
    classroom. All for free. Or so I thought.</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">I experienced the world in that time as a gift econ-
    omy, "goods and services" not purchased but received
    as gifts from the earth. Of course I was blissfully
    unaware of how my parents must have struggled to
    make ends meet in the wage economy raging far from
    this field.</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">In our family, the presents we gave one another
    were almost always homemade. I thought that was the
    definition of a gift: something you made for someone
    else. We made all our Christmas gifts: piggy banks
    from old bottles of bleach, hot pads from broken
    clothespins, and puppets from retired socks. My mother
    says it was because we had no money for store-bought
    presents. It didn't seem like a hardship to me; it was
    something special.</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">My father loves wild strawberries, so for Father's
    Day my mother would almost always make him straw-
    berry shortcake. She baked the crusty shortcakes and
    whipped the heavy cream, but we kids were responsible
    for the berries. We each got an old jar or two and spent
    the Saturday before the celebration out in the fields,
    taking forever to fill them as more and more berries
    ended up in our mouths. Finally, we returned home and
    poured them out on the kitchen table to sort out the
    bugs. I'm sure we missed some, but Dad never men-
    tioned the extra protein.</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">In fact, he thought wild strawberry shortcake was
    the best possible present, or so he had us convinced. It
    was a gift that could never be bought. As children
    raised by strawberries, we were probably unaware that
    the gift of berries was from the fields themselves, not
    from us. Our gift was time and attention and care and
    red-stained fingers. Heart berries, indeed.</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">Gifts from the earth or from each other establish a
    particular relationship, an obligation of sorts to give, to
    receive, and to reciprocate. The field gave to us, we
    gave to my dad, and we tried to give back to the straw-
    berries. When the berry season was done, the plants
    would send out slender red runners to make new plants.
    Because I was fascinated by the way they would travel
    over the ground looking for good places to take root, I
    would weed out little patches of bare ground where the
    runners touched down. Sure enough, tiny little roots
    would emerge from the runner and by the end of the
    season there were even more plants, ready to bloom
    under the next Strawberry Moon. No person taught us
    this-the strawberries showed us. Because they had
    given us a gift, an ongoing relationship opened between
    us.</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">Farmers around us grew a lot of strawberries and
    frequently hired kids to pick for them. My siblings and
    I would ride our bikes a long way to Crandall's farm to
    pick berries to earn spending money. A dime for every
    quart we picked.</p>

<p><strong>Passage II</strong></p>
<p><STRONG>SOCIAL SCIENCE:</STRONG> This passage is adapted from <em>The Air-
plane: How Ideas Gave Us Wings</em> by Jay Spenser (©2008 by 
Jay Spenser).</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">The invention of the airplane was a battleground
for two warring paradigms about what the airplane
would be like. Paradigms are mind-sets created by what
we think we know. Depending on how closely they
match the actuality, these mental models either can help
us succeed or can plane blinders over our eyes that keep
us from perceiving what we later realize was obvious
all along.</p>
    
<p style="text-indent:40px">Working under the right paradigm helped Ameri-
cans Orville and Wilbur Wright to succeed even as a
wrong one sabotaged the hopes of Europe's many
experimenters. If not for this situation, the French-
who felt they had invented the flight because of the success
of the Montgolfiers' hot-air balloons in 1783-might
well have been first. If so, the airplane, like the automo-
bile before it, would have been a European invention.</p>
        
<p style="text-indent:40px">What led Europe's aerial experimenters astray? It
was William Samuel Henson. Or more accurately, it
was the powerful sway of Henson's persuasive vision of
what aviation would be.</p>        
    
<p style="text-indent:40px">First published in the early 1840s, the engraved
illustrations of Henson Aerial Steam Carriage
(a passenger-carrying airplane) continued to appear off
and on in newspapers, magazines, and books for more
than half a century. More thrilling artwork of heavier-
than-air flying machines was hard to imagine, and the
very sight of this aerial stagecoach spurred Europe's
aerial experimenters to redouble their efforts. Unfortu-
nately, however, it also handed them a lot of incorrect
notions.</p>
    
<p style="text-indent:40px">The concept of an aerial carriage brought with it a
concomitant expectation that people would drive air-
planes around the sky making flat turns as they did
in horse-drawn vehicles. This unquestioned assumption
shaped how France's early experimentation approached
airplane design, and it cost them dearly.</p>
    
<p style="text-indent:40px">Part of Henson's paradigm worked. For example,
airplanes would indeed pitch their noses up or down to
climb or descend. This was intuitive because horse-
drawn carriages do just that when traversing hilly coun-
tryside. But carriages don't tilt sideways, or at least not
very far, because that leads to a catastrophic upset.</p>
    
<p style="text-indent:40px">Henson's vision told Europe's early experimenters
that their airplanes must not be permitted to tilt side to
side or else catastrophe would ensue. To ensure that this
never happened, some experimenters used strongly
upward-angled wings so that the airplane would be self-
righting in flight. Others placed vertical fore-and-aft
fabric panels between the wings of their biplanes to
prevent sideslips. Both these features suggest that
Europe's pioneers were terrified of <em>banking</em>, or drop-
ping a wing in flight.</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">Another place where Henson's Aerial Steam Car-
raige paradigm misled people was the vital issue of
controllability. Controlling horse-drawn vehicles does
not require constant active involvement on the driver's
part. The horses are set in motion and the reins are not
used again until the horses need further instruction.</p>   
    
<p style="text-indent:40px">Consequently, Europe's "early birds" were
remarkably cavalier about controllability. To them, all
one needed to do was create an inherently stable craft
whose wings never dropped to either side. After nosing
this vehicle aloft, one would simply "drive" it around
the sky.</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">A wealthy Brazilian named Alberto Santos-
Dumont performed Europe's first heavier-than-air
flights late in 1906. His 14-<em>bis</em> was largely uncontrol-
lable, but that didn't bother him; his goal was simply to
get into the air. This disregard for a key requirement of
flight was then so pervasive that more than a year
would pass before any European figured out how to 
actually land where he had taken off.</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">Wilbur and Orville worked under a different mind-
set. They too had seen Henson's artwork, but it didn't
sing to them because they were bicyclists. Their inti-
mate association with this vehicle, its operation, and its
manufacture led them to approach flight development
in a different way than their European counterparts.</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">Wilbur and Orville were not in the least scared of
tilting to one side or the other in flight. Banking in
flight seemed natural to them because a bicyclist leans
into turns. What's more, they understood from the
outset that the airplane needed to be controllable
around all three axes and that the pilot had to be inti-
mately involved with this process while aloft. These
two insights were intuitive because the bicyclist must
constantly direct his two-wheeled vehicle by means of a 
combination of active balance and coordinated use of
handlebars, acceleration, and braking. If the bicyclist
doesn't stay on top of these things every minute, he's in
for a spill.</p>

A Life of Duke Ellington</em> by Terry Teachout (©2013 by Terry

You There: Mavis Staples, The Staples Singers, and the

<p>Passage A by Terry Teachout</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">What Duke Ellington sought and got from his
"accumulation of personalities" was a loose, festive
ensemble sound far removed from the clean precision
of Benny Goodman's band. He had no interest in the
smoothly blended playing that leaders like Goodman,
Jimmie Lunceford, and Artie Shaw demanded from
their groups. He preferred to hire musicians with home-
made techniques that were different to the point of
apparent incompatibility, then juxtapose their idiosyn-
cratic sounds as a pointillist painter might place dots of
red and greed side by side on his canvas, finding inspi-
ration in their technical limitations ("With a musician
who plays the full compass of his instrument as fast or
as slow as possible, there seems, paradoxically, less
opportunity to create"). That is why his charts never
sound quite right when performed by other groups,
however accomplished the individual players may be. It
is also why a keen-eared virtuoso like Jack Teagarden,
the greatest jazz trombonist of his generation, found it
impossible to enjoy the Ellington band. "I never did
like anything Ellington ever did," he said. "He never
had a band all in tune, always had a bad tone quality
and bad blend." What Teagarden meant, whether he
knew it or not, was that the band had an <em>unconventional</em>
tone quality, one that had little in common with
received ideas about how a big band ought to sound.
Asked why he hired Al Hibbler when he already had a
singer on the payroll, Ellington replied, "My ear makes
my decision." To him, no other ear mattered.</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">Billy Strayhorn, who saw Ellington's working
methods up close and understood them best, gave them
a name in a 1952 article about his mentor: "Ellington
plays the piano, but his real instrument is the band.
Each member of his band is to him a distinctive tone
color and set of emotions, which he mixes with others
equally distinctive to produce a third thing, which I call
the Ellington Effect." Sometimes he worked "on" his
players as a choreographer makes a ballet "on" his
dancers, passing out or dictating scraps of music, then
shaping and reshaping them on the spot into a piece that
would later be reduced to written form. Even a work
that had already been notated was subject in the heat of
the moment to total transformation motivated solely by
the whim of the composer. The goal, he explained, was
"to mold the music around the man," and the men
around whom his music was so tightly molded rarely
sounded more themselves than when they were playing
it.</p>

<p>Passage B by Greg Kot</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">In a six-member male gospel group calling them-
selves the Trumpet Jubilees, Pops was third lead,
singing mostly in a falsetto voice, and managed the
group, booking their appearances and scheduling the
rehearsals. He was a stickler for punctuality and preci-
sion, for looking and sounding sharp, for taking the job
seriously. But not everyone in the group shared his
commitment; his exasperation mounted until one day he
quit. Pops decided to devote his time to a singing group
that he could run from top to bottom, that would show
up on time at every rehearsal, no questions asked.
Mostly, he wanted to sing because it was a crucial part
of his identity; since boyhood all he could remember
was the pleasure singing brought him and his older
brothers and sisters. When singing in the Trumpet
Jubilees became a chore, he turned to his family.</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">"One night he came home early because the guys
in the Trumpet Jubilees didn't show up for rehearsal,"
Mavis says. "He was disgusted. He went into the closet
in the living room and got a little guitar he had brought
home from the pawnshop. It didn't have more than
three or four strings on it, but it was enough to get us
started."</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">Mavis, Pervis, Cleotha, and Yvonne sat in a semi-
circle in front of their father on the beige carpet in their
living room at 506 East 33rd Street. Pops hunched over
his $7 guitar and plucked a series of notes, assigning
one to each of his children.</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">"People always ask, 'How do we get the sound we
have?' And that came from my father-the sound he
had with his family in Mississippi when they sang on
the gallery after dinner. He gave us [an E chord] and the
parts his brothers and sisters would sing. He would hit a
note on his guitar and would say, 'Now, Mavis go here,' 
a baritone part, because even then I had the deepest
voice. Pervis was second lead behind Pops because he
had the most experience, and he could hit those high
notes like Michael Jackson later could. Cleedi had the
high harmony. The first song he taught us was 'Will the
Circle Be Unbroken.'"

<p><strong>Passage IV</strong></p>
<p><STRONG>NATURAL SCIENCE:</STRONG> This passage is adapted from the article
"Tales from the Pit" by Andre Curry (©2014 by Smithsonian 
Institution). 

<p>The Messel Pit, located in central Germany, is known for its
   fossils of mammals from the Eocene epoch.</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">At some point around 50 million years ago, under-
ground water came into contact with a vein of molten
rock. High-pressure steam erupted, forming a crater
with steep sides. As water seeped in, it created a lake
shaped more like a drinking glass than a soup bowl.
Any animal that fell in sank quickly to the bottom.</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">Still, that alone doesn't explain why so many land
mammals-not to mention birds, bats and insects-per-
ished in the lake that became the Messel Pit. One
theory is that carbon dioxide periodically bubbled up
from deep beneath the lake bottom, smothering animals
near the shore. Another possibility is that some of the
summer algae blooms were toxic, poisoning animals
that had chosen the wrong time and place to slake their
thirst. Or perhaps smaller animals died nearby and were
washed in by small floods or rushing streams.</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">The lake was so deep that oxygen didn't circulate
near the bottom, which meant that there were no bottom
feeders around to consume the dead and dying animals.
Year after year, algae scumming the lake surface
bloomed and died, and so layers of fine clay and dead
micro-organisms drifted to the bottom. Each layer was
as thick as a strand of hair. It took 250 years to build up
an inch of mud. Over millions and millions of years,
plants and animals were preserved like flowers pressed
between the pages of a book, and algae and the other 
organic matter turned into oil shale.</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">Among the thousand of fossils that paleontolo-
gists have recovered at Messel Pit are specimens repre-
senting nearly 45 different mammal species. Those
finds are critical to understanding how warmblooded
creatures evolved. Mammals and dinosaurs appeared at
nearly the same time around 200 millions years ago. But
dinosaurs were so well suited to the environment that
they crowded out any competition. Mammals lived on
the margins, mostly tiny creatures eking out a living by
eating insects under the cover of darkness. "They just
tried to stay out of the way," says Thomas Lehmann, a
Senckenberg Research Institute paleontologist. And so
it went for nearly 150 million years.</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">Then, in an instant, everything changed, appar-
ently when an asteroid or comet struck Earth 66 million
years ago and dramatically altered the climate, eventu-
ally wiping out the giant reptiles. The diversity of
species found among the Messel Pit fossils reveals that
mammals rushed to fill every empty ecological nook
and cranny they could find. "They really tried every-
thing-flying, jumping, running, tree-dwelling, ant-
eating," says Lehmann. "From the point of view of
evolution, Messel is a fantastic laboratory to see what
life might have given us."</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">Might have, but in many cases didn't. Messel's
most fascinating specimens may be those species that
have no living relatives, though they look jarringly
familiar. In the visitor center, kids crowd around to
watch as a conservator armed with toothbrushes, dental
picks and scalpels cleans layers of oil shale away from
a fossil unearthed just a few weeks earlier. To me, the
skeleton of <em>Ailuravus macrurus</em> looks like that of a
giant squirrel. It's three feet long, including its bushy
tail. Near the ribs a black stain traces the creature's fos-
silized digestive tract. Despite its tail, <em>Ailuravus</em> is no
squirrel ancestor. It's an evolutionary dead end;
<em>Ailuravus</em> and all of its relatives died out more than
37 million years ago. Why? Maybe they fell victim to
climate changes, or a better-adapted competitor, or dis-
appearing food sources, or simple bad luck.</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px"><em>Ailuravus'</em> resemblance to a modern squirrel is an
example of evolutionary convergence. Given enough
time, adaptations may lead to nearly identical solu-
tions-bushy tails, say, or powerful, kangaroo-like hind
legs-popping up in different species. "It's like using
the same interlocking toy bricks to build different
forms," says Lehmann.</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">And there are forms aplenty at the Messel Pit. The
exquisitely preserved fossils have provided paleontolo-
gists with unprecedented insights into the adaptive
strategies-some successful, others not-adopted by
mammals for feeding, movement and even reproduc-
tion. For instance, the contents of the tiny prehistoric
horse's stomach-fossilized leaves and grape seeds-
indicate that the animal was not a grazer but a browser,
eating what it found on the forest floor. The paleontolo-
gists also found eight fossilized specimens of pregnant
mares, each carrying a single foal. That discovery sug-
gests that the early horses had already adopted herd
behavior, since joint care would be the best way to
guarantee the survival of small numbers of offspring.</p>

<p><strong>Passage I</strong></p>
<p><STRONG>LITERARY NARRATIVE:</STRONG> This passage is adapted from the 
novel <em>Bitter Grounds</em> by Sandra Ben&iacute;tez (©1997 by Sandra 
Ben&iacute;tez).</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">Alvaro Tobar gripped the wheel of his convertible
and leaned into the approaching curve. He loved the
sense of power he experienced when he was in the
driver's seat. He'd owned the car since before the war,
and maybe now that the war had ended, he would buy a
newer model. This convertible he would not sell, how-
ever. He patted the wheel as if reassuring the vehicle of
his loyalty.</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">It was late afternoon in early November. The air
was heavy with coming rain, surely one of the last
downpours before the dry season. Alvaro would wait
for the first drops to fall before he stopped to raise the
car's top. He was only a few kilometers from San
Salvador, and, once inside the city limits, only minutes
from home.</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">Alavaro's thoughts turned to his cotton harvest. For
the past week, he'd been on the eastern coast, at his
plantation outside Usulut&aacute;n. On this trip, he had helped
ready the hacienda for the harvest, which would start at
month's end. Much was riding on his cotton. He always
referred to it as "mi algod&oacute;n." My cotton, a venture that
he, and not his mother, controlled. He pictured his
mother's strong, handsome face. Eugenia Herrera de
Tobar. At seventy-three, do&ntilde;a Eugenia was still the 
undisputed ruler of the Tobar family. As the doyenne,
she controlled her business and private affairs with as 
much vigor as she had since her husband's death. 
Because she had Alvaro and his four older sisters to 
raise, she took over the reins of her husband's cattle- 
ranching operation and his vast property holdings and 
never relinquished them. Under her control, her hus- 
band's enterprises prospered. Oh, there were moments 
when she cried out against the fate that had sent her 
down a path strewn with no such responsibility, "It's a 
heavy burden life has handed me," she liked to say. "A 
burden I long to have lifted from my shoulders." Even 
as a youngster, however, when Alvaro heard his 
mother's lamentations, he had glimpsed into her heart 
as if her chest were made of glass. In her heart, he had 
seen the pleasure the burden gave her.</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">It was power that obsessed her. And could he 
blame her? He had had a whiff of the heady scent of 
power himself. He smelled it in his cotton. He'd been in 
the business for four years. The first three years were 
hopeful ones. There was a world war, and unlike coffee, 
cotton prices rose steadily, thanks to the growth of the 
local textile industry.</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">From the start, his mother had not encouraged him 
to strike out on his own. "Only fools go into cotton 
when there's cattle to be raised or coffee to be grown," 
she said, compelling him to work all the harder to prove 
her wrong. He had spent months scouting for the right 
land among the family's properties on the flat coastal 
plain. When he found it, he had lovingly sown the best 
seed himself. And he had kept a vigil on the growing 
plants. Lying in a hut next to the field, he was present at 
the moment the buds broke into flower.</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">Once Alvaro reached Avenida Cuscatl&aacute;n, he accel- 
erated, weaving in and out of traffic. Cotton. A man 
took a risk growing it, for cotton might never make the 
money coffee would, but Alvaro did not allow this 
thought to perturb him. He had various means of 
making a living: There was real estate to be bought and 
sold, a seat on the bank board, the shrimping business 
on the coast. He had disbanded his law practice years 
ago, although, at times, he took a case or two on a con- 
sulting basis. But it was in the cotton business that he'd 
placed his heart and money. Last year, so sure was he of 
a better-than-ever yield, that he'd invested his wife's 
money in it as well. It was the inheritance from her 
grandfather, bequeathed to her twelve years before. 
Magda had entrusted it to Alvaro, and he had carefully 
managed the money, seeing to its growth. When the 
time was right, she would use her inheritance for her 
own business scheme: a gift shop named Tesoros.</p> 

<p style="text-indent:40px">The disaster of last year's harvest flooded his 
mind. He sank back against the seat, remembering his 
cotton, the bolls swollen and soon to burst into a cloud 
of white, infested malevolently with weevils.</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">But this year would be different. He had taken 
measures. He had spent the better part of the week 
stockpiling insecticides that would insure this crop 
against failure. He had not told Magda any of this, of 
course. Why cause her concern? It was all a matter of 
cash flow, of money transferred from one account to the 
other, of bank loans and promissory notes. This year, 
because of his insecticides, would bring his first bumper 
crop.</p>

<p><strong>Passage II</strong></p>
<p><STRONG>SOCIAL SCIENCE:</STRONG> This passage is adapted from <em>The Tipping
Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference</em> by Malcolm
Gladwell (©2002 by Malcolm Gladwell).</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">There is a concept in cognitive psychology called 
the channel capacity, which refers to the amount of 
space in our brain for certain kinds of information. Sup- 
pose, for example, that I played you a number of differ- 
ent musical tones, at random, and asked you to identify 
each one with a number. If I played you a really low 
tone, you would call it one, and if I played you a 
medium tone you would call it two, and a high tone you 
would call three. The purpose of the test is to find out 
how long you can continue to distinguish among differ- 
ent tones. Most people can divide tones into only about 
six different categories before they begin to make mis- 
takes and start lumping different tones in the same cate- 
gory. This is a remarkably consistent finding, If, for 
example, I played you five very high pitched tones, 
you'd be able to tell them apart. And if I played you 
five very low pitched tones, you'd be able to tell them 
apart. You'd think, then, that if I combined those high 
and low tones and played them into ten categories. But 
you won't be able to. Chances are you'll still be stuck 
at about six categories.</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">As human beings, we can only handle so much 
information at once. Once we pass a certain boundary, 
we become overwhelmed. What I'm describing here is 
an intellectual capacity-our ability to process raw 
information. But if you think about it, we clearly have a 
channel capacity for feelings as well.</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">Take a minute, for example, to make a list of all 
the people whom you would consider yourself truly 
close to. The average answer is 12 names. Those names 
make up what psychologists call our sympathy group. 
Why aren't groups any larger? Partly it's a question of 
time. If you look at the names on your sympathy list, 
they are probably the people whom you devote the most 
attention to. If your list was twice as long, would you 
still be as close to everyone? Probably not. To be some- 
one's friend requires a minimum investment of time. 
More than that, though, it takes emotional energy. At a 
certain point, at somewhere between 10 and 15 people, 
we begin to overload, just as we begin to overload when 
we have to distinguish between too many tones.</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">Perhaps the most interesting natural limit, how- 
ever, is what might be called our social channel capac- 
ity. The case for a social capacity has been made, most 
persuasively, by the British anthropologist Robin 
Dunbar. Dunbar begins with a simple observation. Pri- 
mates-monkeys, chimps, baboons, humans-have the 
biggest brains of all mammals. More important, a spe- 
cific part of the brain of humans and other primates- 
the region known as the neocortex, which deals with 
complex thought and reasoning-is huge by mammal 
standards. For years, scientists have argued back and 
forth about why this is the case. One theory is that our 
brains evolved because our primate ancestors began to 
engage in more sophisticated food gathering: instead of 
just eating grasses and leaves they began eating fruit, 
which takes more thinking power. You travel much far- 
ther to find fruit than leaves, so you need to be able to 
create mental maps. You have to worry about ripeness. 
You have to peel parts away in order to eat the flesh of 
a fruit, and so no. The problem with that theory is that 
if you try to match up brain size with eating patterns 
among primates, it doesn't work. So what does corre- 
late with brain size? The answer, Dunbar argues, is 
group size. If you look at any species of primate-at 
every variety of monkey and ape-the larger their neo- 
cortex is, the larger the average size of the groups they 
live with.</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">Dunbar's argument is that brains evolve, they get 
bigger, in order to handle the complexities of larger 
social groups. If you belong to a group of five people, 
Dunbar points out, you have to keep track of ten sepa- 
rate relationships: yoru relationships with the four 
others in your circle and the six other two-way relation- 
ships between the others. That's what it means to know 
everyone in the circle. You have to understand the per- 
sonal dynamics of the group. If you belong to a group 
of twenty people, however, there are now 190 two-way 
relationships to keep track of: 19 involving yourself and 
171 involving the rest of the group. Even a relatively 
small increase in the size of a group creates a signifi- 
cant additional social and intellectual burden. Humans 
socialize in the largest groups of all primates because 
we are the only animals with brains large enough to 
handle the complexities of that social arrangement.</p>

<p>Passage A by Lia Purpura</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">Why are miniature things so compelling?</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">The miniature is mysterious. We wonder how all 
those parts work when they're so small. It's why we 
linger over an infant's fingers and toes, those astonish- 
ing replicas: we can't quite <em>believe</em> they work. Chi- 
huahuas work. Birds and bonsai trees work. Miniatures 
are improbable, unlikely. Causes to marvel. Surprises. 
Feats of engineering. Products of an obsessive detailer.</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">Miniatures offer changes of scale by which we 
measure ourselves anew. On one hand, miniatures posit 
an omniscient onlooker, able to take in the whole at 
once. Consider your <em>self</em> in relation to dollhouses, 
snowglobes, frog spawn, aquariums, souvenir key- 
chains you look through to see a picture of the very 
spot you're visiting, stilled. You are large enough to 
hold such things fully in hand. On the other hand, 
miniatures issue invitations to their realm, and suggest 
we forget or disregard our size. In dollhouse land, you 
can walk through the kitchen, livingroom, bedroom 
with your three inch high friend and, face pressed to the 
window, feel the cushions of the thumbnail loveseat 
hold you. Fit inside the miniature, we experience cer- 
tian states of being or belief: worlds in a grain of sand;
eternities in wildflowers. Regions beyond our normal- 
sized perception. Whether we are, in relation to them, 
omniscient or companionably small beings, miniatures 
invite us to leave our known selves and perspectives 
behind.</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">Miniatures encourage attention-in the way whis- 
pering requires a listener to quiet down and incline 
toward the speaker. Sometimes we need binoculars, 
microscopes, viewmasters to assist our looking, but 
mediated or not, miniatures suggest there is more there 
than meets the eye easily. They suggest there is much to 
miss if we don't look hard at spaces, crevices, crannies.</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">The miniature, a working, functioning complete 
world unto itself, is not merely a "small" or "brief" 
thing or a "shortened" form of something larger. Minia- 
tures transcend their size. Most strangely to me, minia- 
tures are radically self-sufficient. The beings who 
inhabit fairylands, those elves and sprites, pixies and 
trolls, don't usually strive to be our pals. They don't 
need us. Their smallness is our problem, or intrigue, or 
desire.</p>

<p>Passage B by James Gardner</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">Without meaning to do so, the Morgan Library has 
created a triumph of conceptual art: the smallest art 
exhibition in the world. "The Prayer Book of Claude de 
France," as the exhibition is called, consists of nothing 
other than "The Prayer Book of Claude de France." At 
2 3/4 by 2 inches, the exhibition and the book are both 
so small that they can fit in the palm of your hand. That 
may not sound like much until you realize that this illu- 
minated miniature contains 132 scenes from the lives of 
Christ, the Virgin, the apostles, and sundry saints. As 
such, it is a gallery unto itself.</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">In "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical 
Reproduction," Walter Benjamin's overrated essay of 
1936, the author famously asserted that no one would 
feel the need to stand before the original when one 
could own a reproduction. The folly of this idea will be 
self-evident to anyone with the remotest sensitivity to 
visual art. No matter how good a reproduction, you 
have to bear physical witness to each pucker and weave 
of canvas, each splash of puddled ink in an Old Master 
drawing. Only then can you truly say that you have seen 
the work of art.</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">It was with such convictions that I rushed over to 
the Morgan to see the tiny commodity in question. 
What a waste of time! Not because the object is lacking 
in worthiness, but because the Morgan's own Web site 
offers a means of examining the book that, in this case, 
far surpasses any direct encounter. Every page of the 
manuscript is there in living color, and the zoom mech- 
anism is so powerful and so precise that you can get in 
closer than if you were hunched over the real thing with 
a strong magnifying glass. Zoom in to one of the fig- 
ures, scarcely the size of a fingernail, and you see the 
tiny head in perfect focus. Zooming in deeper, you see 
the beard on the head, then the hairs on the beard, then 
the point at which the whole thing dissolves into 
abstract art, as the strokes of the artist's single-hair 
brush mere with the warped and mottled surface of the 
vellum.</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">The miniature in question was commissioned for 
Queen Claude of France. Nearly three generations after 
the invention of printing, there was no practical reason 
to commission this work. Rather, it was the delight in 
luxury itself, as well, perhaps, as the spirit of sacrifice 
that brought this work existence.</p>

<p><strong>Passage VI</strong></p>
<p><STRONG>NATURAL SCIENCE:</STRONG> This passage is adapted from the article 
    "Back to the Future" by J. Madeleine Nash (©2008 by J.
    Madeleine Nash).

<p style="text-indent:40px">The Sand Creek Divide is a high point in 
Wyoming's Big Horn Basin. From it you can see the 
emerald patchwork of irrigated sugar beet and malt 
barley fields that hug the Big Horn River as well as the 
jagged mountain ranges that define the edges of this 
hars mid-latitude desert.</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">But between 55 and 56 million years ago, says 
Scott Wing, a paleo-botanist at the Smithsonian's 
Museum of Natural History, the Big Horn Basin was a 
balmy, swampy Eden, teeming with flora and fauna that 
would be at home in today's coastal Carolinas. And 
then, all of a sudden, things got a whole lot warmer. In 
a geological eye blink-less than 10,000 years, some 
think-global mean temperatures shot up by around 
10 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">The Big Red, a sinuous ribbon of rose-colored 
rock, is the most vivid marker of this exceptionally 
torrid time-the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, 
or PETM, as most paleontologists call it. Even before it 
had a name, the PETM was starting to fascinate Wing. 
For some time, it had been clear to paleontologists 
studying the evolution of mammals that the transition 
between the Paleocene and the Eocene was marked by 
the kind of innovative burst that implies sweeping eco- 
logical change. Yet no hint of such a change had 
appeared in any of the fossil leaves Wing had collected. 
He would stare at leaves from the Paleocene and leaves 
from the Eocene, but see almost no difference between 
them. "It was getting to be annoying," he recalls.</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">The Paleocene is the geological epoch that started
65 million years ago. At the time, mammals were rather 
simple, general-purpose creatures with a few specializa- 
tions. Then, barely 10 million years later, at the dawn 
of the Eocene, the first relatives of deer abruptly 
appear, along with the first primates and first horses.</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">"You can literally draw a line in the rock," says 
Philip Gingerich, a vertebrate paleontologist at the Uni- 
versity of Michigan. "Above it there are horses; below 
it there aren't." In fact, where Gingerich works-at 
Polecat Bench, in the northern sector of the Big Horn 
Basin-you can actually see the line, in the form of a 
band of light gray sandstone. Oddly enough, many 
fossil mammals commonly found about this line, 
including those first horses, were abnormally small. 
Typically, Gingerich says, Eocene horses grew to the 
size of modern-day cocker spaniels, but these horses 
were "about the size of Siamese cats."</p> 

<p style="text-indent:40px">In 1991, as Gingerich and others were marveling 
over the miniature mammals of Polecat Bench, 
oceanographers James Kennett and Lowell Stott inves- 
tigated a major extinction of small, shelly creatures 
that, during the late Paleocene, lived on the sea floor 
off the coast of Antarctica. This massive die-off, they 
found, coincided with a steep rise in deep-ocean tem- 
peratures and a curious spike in atmospheric carbon.</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">Less than a year later, paleontologist Paul Koch 
and paleo-oceanographer James Zachos teamed up with 
Gingerich to show that this geochemical glitch had also 
left its calling card on land. The trio established this 
indirectly by measuring the carbon content of fossilized 
teeth and nodules plucked from the Big Horn Basin's 
55.5-million-year-old rocks.</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">To Wing, it began to seem increasingly implausi- 
ble that plant communities could have segued through 
the PETM unaffected. So in 1994, he started a methodi- 
cal search for the fossils, returning year after year to the 
Big Horn Basin.</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">At first, he found just a smattering of leaves, too 
few to suggest any pattern. Then, in 2005, at the end of 
a long day, he slid his shovel into a grayish mound and 
pulled out a tiny leaf. "I knew immediately that this 
was totally different from anything I'd seen before."</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">From that one site, Wing sent on to extract more 
than 2,000 leaf fossils representing 30 different species.
Missing from the mix are the cypresses and other 
conifers that were so common during the Paleocene; 
gone also are the distant cousins of broadleaf temperate 
zone trees. In their place are the legumes, a family of 
plants, shrubs and trees that thrive today in seasonally 
dry tropical and subtropical areas.</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">"What you see is almost a complete changeover 
from what was growing here before," Wing marvels. 
"What this means is that you could have stood in this 
one spot in Wyoming, surrounded by a forest, and 
everything would have looked pretty much the same for 
millions of years. And then, over a few tens of thou- 
sands of years, almost all the plants you're familiar 
with disappear and are replaced by plants you've never 
seen before in your life."</p>

<p><strong>Passage I</strong></p>
<p><STRONG>LITERARY NARRATIVE:</STRONG> This passage is adapted from the 
book <em>Flower Confidential</em> by Amy Stewart (©2007 by Amy 
Stewart).</p>

<p>"Holland" and "the Netherlands" refer to the same country.</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">I woke up at 5 a.m. and stared a the ceiling of my 
Amsterdam hotel room. Outside, the canal boats, which 
were rented to rowdy college students, had just gone 
quiet. This was a city of late risers. I got dressed and 
walked gingerly through the lobby, not wanting to wake 
the innkeeper who slept on the ground floor, and 
stepped in the dark, empty streets. The fact is that if 
you want to go see someone in the flower trade, this is 
the hour at which you must rise. Even then, when you 
finally show up at 6 or 7 a.m., blinking in the sudden 
daylight and trying to remember why you scheduled the 
meeting in the first place, the person you've gone to 
meet will look impatient, as though half the day is 
wasted already.</p> 

<p style="text-indent:40px">I was on my way to Aalsmeer to see the famous 
Dutch flower auction. It's known around the world as a 
remarkably high-tech, high-speed way to see flowers, 
but it had modest beginnings: In a caf&eacute; out side of Am- 
sterdam in 1911 some growers came up with the idea of 
holding an auction to give them more control over how 
their flowers were priced and sold. They called their 
auction Bloemenlust. It was not long before a compet- 
ing auction sprang up nearby-the history of flower 
markets everywhere is that as soon as there is one, there 
are two-and each day as the auctions ended, flowers 
were piled onto bicycles and boats to be delievered along 
Holland's narrow canals and even narrower streets. This 
arranged continued until 1968, the two auctions 
thriving nearly side by side, until they finally merged 
and became what is known today as Bloemenveiling 
Aalsmeer, the largest of a handful of major flower auc- 
tions going on year-round in the Netherlands.</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">The bus to Aalsmeer took me through the shut- 
tered streets of Amsterdam and headed south, past the 
airport. The world seemed to be coming to life at last, 
and on the road we passed dozens of trucks-some of 
them plastered with the same grower and wholesaler 
logos you'd see in Miami-carrying flowers to and 
from the auction. This next phase of a flower's life, 
after it leave sthe grower and before it settles into a 
vase on someone's hall table, is remarkable for both its 
duration and its complexity. A flower can spend a week 
making its way through a maze of warehouses, airports,
auctions, and wholesale markets, and it will emerge 
from this exhausting journey looking almost as fresh as 
the day it was picked.</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">The existence of this auction highlights one major 
difference between flowers destined for the European 
market and those sold in the United States. The flowers 
that I saw arriving in Miami were headed in every 
direction at once: they were going by truck, rail, and 
plane to wholesale markets, distribution centers, bou- 
quet makers, retailers, and even directly to customers. 
There is not a single, centralized market for flowers in 
the United States. But the flowers that come into 
Schiphol Airport outside of Amsterdam, the major port 
of entry for European flowers, are almost all going to 
Aalsmeer. This is the very center of the flower trade, 
handling most of the flowers sold on the European 
market and some goods going to Russia, China, 
Japan, and even the United States. The flowers going up 
for auction come from Kenya, Zimbabwe, Israel, 
Colombia, Ecuador, and European countries, making 
this a sort of global stopping-off point for most of the 
industry. Every flower market around the world 
watches the Dutch auction, which acts as a sort of 
engine for the trade, setting prices and standards world- 
wide. If you want to follow a flower to market, you'll 
end up here eventually.</p>

<p style="text-indent:40px">By the time the bus pulled into the large circular 
driveway at the public entrance to the auction, the day 
really was half over. Flowers and plants had been arriv- 
ing since midnight, and bidding started before dawn. I 
stepped off the bus into a kind of floral rush hour: 
trucks roaring past, people racing from one end of the 
complex to another, the morning sun glaring down. This 
place is a behemoth in the small town of Aalsmeer. It 
employs ten thousand people in a town of just twenty 
thousand and occupies almost 450 acres, an area larger 
than Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom and Epcot 
theme parks combined. In fact, the auction is like a city 
in itself, one that runs twenty-four hours a day. All the 
major growers and wholesalers keep an office, and 
maybe a warehouse and a loading dock, at Aalsmeer. A 
full 20 percent of the cut flowers in the word are sold 
at this very spot, and about half of the world's cut-
flower supply moves through the Dutch auction system.</p>
