<p><strong>Passage I</strong></p>
<p><STRONG>LITERARY NARRATIVE:</STRONG> This passage is adapted from the 
    book <em>Braiding Sweetgrass: Indigenous Wisdom, Scientific
    Knowledge, and the Teachings of Plants</em> by Robin Wall 
    Kimmerer (©2013 by Robin Wall Kimmerer).</p>

<p>     Even now, after more than fifty Strawberry Moons,
    finding a patch of wild strawberries still touches me
    with a sensation of surprise, a feeling of unworthiness
    and gratitude for the generosity and kindness that
    comes with an unexpected gift all wrapped in red and
    green. "Really? For me? Oh, you shouldn't have." After
    fifty years they still raise the question of how to 
    respond to their generosity. Sometimes it feels like
    a silly question with a very simple answer: eat them.</p>

<p>     But I know that someone else has wondered these
    same things. In our Creation stories the origin of staw-
    berries is important. Skywoman's beautiful daughter,
    whom she carried in her womb from Skyworld, grew on
    the good green earth, loving and loved by all the other
    beings. But tragedy befell her when she died giving 
    birth to her twins, Flint and Sapling. Heartbroken, Sky-
    woman buried her beloved daughter in the earth. Her
    final gifts, our most revered plants, grew from her body.
    The strawberry arose from her heart. In Potawatomi, the
    strawberry is <em>ode min,</em> the heart berry. We recognize
    them as the leaders of the berries, the first to bear fruit.</p>

<p>     Strawberries first shaped my view of a world full
    of gifts simply scattered at your feet. A gift comes to
    you through no action of your own, free, having moved
    toward you without your beckoning. It is not a reward;
    you cannot earn it, or call it to you, or even deserve it.
    And yet it appears. Your only role is to be open-eyed
    and present. Gifts exist in a realm of humility and 
    mystery-as with random acts of kindness, we do not
    know their source.</p>

<p>     Those fields of my childhood showered us with
    strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, hickory nuts in
    the fall, bouquets of wildflowers brought to my mom,
    and family walks on Sunday afternoon. They were our
    playground, retreat, wildlife sanctuary, and ecology
    classroom. All for free. Or so I thought.</p>

<p>     I experienced the world in that time as a gift econ-
    omy, "goods and services" not purchased but received
    as gifts from the earth. Of course I was blissfully
    unaware of how my parents must have struggled to
    make ends meet in the wage economy raging far from
    this field.</p>

<p>     In our family, the presents we gave one another
    were almost always homemade. I thought that was the
    definition of a gift: something you made for someone
    else. We made all our Christmas gifts: piggy banks
    from old bottles of bleach, hot pads from broken
    clothespins, and puppets from retired socks. My mother
    says it was because we had no money for store-bought
    presents. It didn't seem like a hardship to me; it was
    something special.</p>

<p>     My father loves wild strawberries, so for Father's
    Day my mother would almost always make him straw-
    berry shortcake. She baked the crusty shortcakes and
    whipped the heavy cream, but we kids were responsible
    for the berries. We each got an old jar or two and spent
    the Saturday before the celebration out in the fields,
    taking forever to fill them as more and more berries
    ended up in our mouths. Finally, we returned home and
    poured them out on the kitchen table to sort out the
    bugs. I'm sure we missed some, but Dad never men-
    tioned the extra protein.</p>

<p>     In fact, he thought wild strawberry shortcake was
    the best possible present, or so he had us convinced. It
    was a gift that could never be bought. As children
    raised by strawberries, we were probably unaware that
    the gift of berries was from the fields themselves, not
    from us. Our gift was time and attention and care and
    red-stained fingers. Heart berries, indeed.</p>

<p>     Gifts from the earth or from each other establish a
    particular relationship, an obligation of sorts to give, to
    receive, and to reciprocate. The field gave to us, we
    gave to my dad, and we tried to give back to the straw-
    berries. When the berry season was done, the plants
    would send out slender red runners to make new plants.
    Because I was fascinated by the way they would travel
    over the ground looking for good places to take root, I
    would weed out little patches of bare ground where the
    runners touched down. Sure enough, tiny little roots
    would emerge from the runner and by the end of the
    season there were even more plants, ready to bloom
    under the next Strawberry Moon. No person taught us
    this-the strawberries showed us. Because they had
    given us a gift, an ongoing relationship opened between
    us.</p>

<p>     Farmers around us grew a lot of strawberries and
    frequently hired kids to pick for them. My siblings and
    I would ride our bikes a long way to Crandall's farm to
    pick berries to earn spending money. A dime for every
    quart we picked.</p>

<p><strong>Passage II</strong></p>
<p><STRONG>SOCIAL SCIENCE:</STRONG> This passage is adapted from <em>The Air-
plane: How Ideas Gave Us Wings</em> by Jay Spenser (©2008 by 
Jay Spenser).</p>

<p>     The invention of the airplane was a battleground
for two warring paradigms about what the airplane
would be like. Paradigms are mind-sets created by what
we think we know. Depending on how closely they
match the actuality, these mental models either can help
us succeed or can plane blinders over our eyes that keep
us from perceiving what we later realize was obvious
all along.</p>
    
<p>     Working under the right paradigm helped Ameri-
cans Orville and Wilbur Wright to succeed even as a
wrong one sabotaged the hopes of Europe's many
experimenters. If not for this situation, the French-
who felt they had invented the flight because of the success
of the Montgolfiers' hot-air balloons in 1783-might
well have been first. If so, the airplane, like the automo-
bile before it, would have been a European invention.</p>
        
<p>     What led Europe's aerial experimenters astray? It
was William Samuel Henson. Or more accurately, it
was the powerful sway of Henson's persuasive vision of
what aviation would be.</p>        
    
<p>     First published in the early 1840s, the engraved
illustrations of Henson Aerial Steam Carriage
(a passenger-carrying airplane) continued to appear off
and on in newspapers, magazines, and books for more
than half a century. More thrilling artwork of heavier-
than-air flying machines was hard to imagine, and the
very sight of this aerial stagecoach spurred Europe's
aerial experimenters to redouble their efforts. Unfortu-
nately, however, it also handed them a lot of incorrect
notions.</p>
    
<p>     The concept of an aerial carriage brought with it a
concomitant expectation that people would drive air-
planes around the sky making flat turns as they did
in horse-drawn vehicles. This unquestioned assumption
shaped how France's early experimentation approached
airplane design, and it cost them dearly.</p>
    
<p>     Part of Henson's paradigm worked. For example,
airplanes would indeed pitch their noses up or down to
climb or descend. This was intuitive because horse-
drawn carriages do just that when traversing hilly coun-
tryside. But carriages don't tilt sideways, or at least not
very far, because that leads to a catastrophic upset.</p>
    
<p>     Henson's vision told Europe's early experimenters
that their airplanes must not be permitted to tilt side to
side or else catastrophe would ensue. To ensure that this
never happened, some experimenters used strongly
upward-angled wings so that the airplane would be self-
righting in flight. Others placed vertical fore-and-aft
fabric panels between the wings of their biplanes to
prevent sideslips. Both these features suggest that
Europe's pioneers were terrified of <em>banking</em>, or drop-
ping a wing in flight.</p>

<p>     Another place where Henson's Aerial Steam Car-
raige paradigm misled people was the vital issue of
controllability. Controlling horse-drawn vehicles does
not require constant active involvement on the driver's
part. The horses are set in motion and the reins are not
used again until the horses need further instruction.</p>   
    
<p>     Consequently, Europe's "early birds" were
remarkably cavalier about controllability. To them, all
one needed to do was create an inherently stable craft
whose wings never dropped to either side. After nosing
this vehicle aloft, one would simply "drive" it around
the sky.</p>

<p>     A wealthy Brazilian named Alberto Santos-
Dumont performed Europe's first heavier-than-air
flights late in 1906. His 14-<em>bis</em> was largely uncontrol-
lable, but that didn't bother him; his goal was simply to
get into the air. This disregard for a key requirement of
flight was then so pervasive that more than a year
would pass before any European figured out how to 
actually land where he had taken off.</p>

<p>     Wilbur and Orville worked under a different mind-
set. They too had seen Henson's artwork, but it didn't
sing to them because they were bicyclists. Their inti-
mate association with this vehicle, its operation, and its
manufacture led them to approach flight development
in a different way than their European counterparts.</p>

<p>     Wilbur and Orville were not in the least scared of
tilting to one side or the other in flight. Banking in
flight seemed natural to them because a bicyclist leans
into turns. What's more, they understood from the
outset that the airplane needed to be controllable
around all three axes and that the pilot had to be inti-
mately involved with this process while aloft. These
two insights were intuitive because the bicyclist must
constantly direct his two-wheeled vehicle by means of a 
combination of active balance and coordinated use of
handlebars, acceleration, and braking. If the bicyclist
doesn't stay on top of these things every minute, he's in
for a spill.</p>

<p>Passage A by Terry Teachout</p>

<p>     What Duke Ellington sought and got from his
"accumulation of personalities" was a loose, festive
ensemble sound far removed from the clean precision
of Benny Goodman's band. He had no interest in the
smoothly blended playing that leaders like Goodman,
Jimmie Lunceford, and Artie Shaw demanded from
their groups. He preferred to hire musicians with home-
made techniques that were different to the point of
apparent incompatibility, then juxtapose their idiosyn-
cratic sounds as a pointillist painter might place dots of
red and greed side by side on his canvas, finding inspi-
ration in their technical limitations ("With a musician
who plays the full compass of his instrument as fast or
as slow as possible, there seems, paradoxically, less
opportunity to create"). That is why his charts never
sound quite right when performed by other groups,
however accomplished the individual players may be. It
is also why a keen-eared virtuoso like Jack Teagarden,
the greatest jazz trombonist of his generation, found it
impossible to enjoy the Ellington band. "I never did
like anything Ellington ever did," he said. "He never
had a band all in tune, always had a bad tone quality
and bad blend." What Teagarden meant, whether he
knew it or not, was that the band had an <em>unconventional</em>
tone quality, one that had little in common with
received ideas about how a big band ought to sound.
Asked why he hired Al Hibbler when he already had a
singer on the payroll, Ellington replied, "My ear makes
my decision." To him, no other ear mattered.</p>

<p>     Billy Strayhorn, who saw Ellington's working
methods up close and understood them best, gave them
a name in a 1952 article about his mentor: "Ellington
plays the piano, but his real instrument is the band.
Each member of his band is to him a distinctive tone
color and set of emotions, which he mixes with others
equally distinctive to produce a third thing, which I call
the Ellington Effect." Sometimes he worked "on" his
players as a choreographer makes a ballet "on" his
dancers, passing out or dictating scraps of music, then
shaping and reshaping them on the spot into a piece that
would later be reduced to written form. Even a work
that had already been notated was subject in the heat of
the moment to total transformation motivated solely by
the whim of the composer. The goal, he explained, was
"to mold the music around the man," and the men
around whom his music was so tightly molded rarely
sounded more themselves than when they were playing
it.</p>

<p>Passage B by Greg Kot</p>

<p>     In a six-member male gospel group calling them-
selves the Trumpet Jubilees, Pops was third lead,
singing mostly in a falsetto voice, and managed the
group, booking their appearances and scheduling the
rehearsals. He was a stickler for punctuality and preci-
sion, for looking and sounding sharp, for taking the job
seriously. But not everyone in the group shared his
commitment; his exasperation mounted until one day he
quit. Pops decided to devote his time to a singing group
that he could run from top to bottom, that would show
up on time at every rehearsal, no questions asked.
Mostly, he wanted to sing because it was a crucial part
of his identity; since boyhood all he could remember
was the pleasure singing brought him and his older
brothers and sisters. When singing in the Trumpet
Jubilees became a chore, he turned to his family.</p>

<p>     "One night he came home early because the guys
in the Trumpet Jubilees didn't show up for rehearsal,"
Mavis says. "He was disgusted. He went into the closet
in the living room and got a little guitar he had brought
home from the pawnshop. It didn't have more than
three or four strings on it, but it was enough to get us
started."</p>

<p>     Mavis, Pervis, Cleotha, and Yvonne sat in a semi-
circle in front of their father on the beige carpet in their
living room at 506 East 33rd Street. Pops hunched over
his $7 guitar and plucked a series of notes, assigning
one to each of his children.</p>

<p>     "People always ask, 'How do we get the sound we
have?' And that came from my father-the sound he
had with his family in Mississippi when they sang on
the gallery after dinner. He gave us [an E chord] and the
parts his brothers and sisters would sing. He would hit a
note on his guitar and would say, 'Now, Mavis go here,' 
a baritone part, because even then I had the deepest
voice. Pervis was second lead behind Pops because he
had the most experience, and he could hit those high
notes like Michael Jackson later could. Cleedi had the
high harmony. The first song he taught us was 'Will the
Circle Be Unbroken.'"

<p><strong>Passage IV</strong></p>
<p><STRONG>NATURAL SCIENCE:</STRONG> This passage is adapted from the article
"Tales from the Pit" by Andre Curry (©2014 by Smithsonian 
Institution). 

<p>The Messel Pit, located in central Germany, is known for its
   fossils of mammals from the Eocene epoch.</p>

<p>     At some point around 50 million years ago, under-
ground water came into contact with a vein of molten
rock. High-pressure steam erupted, forming a crater
with steep sides. As water seeped in, it created a lake
shaped more like a drinking glass than a soup bowl.
Any animal that fell in sank quickly to the bottom.</p>

<p>     Still, that alone doesn't explain why so many land
mammals-not to mention birds, bats and insects-per-
ished in the lake that became the Messel Pit. One
theory is that carbon dioxide periodically bubbled up
from deep beneath the lake bottom, smothering animals
near the shore. Another possibility is that some of the
summer algae blooms were toxic, poisoning animals
that had chosen the wrong time and place to slake their
thirst. Or perhaps smaller animals died nearby and were
washed in by small floods or rushing streams.</p>

<p>     The lake was so deep that oxygen didn't circulate
near the bottom, which meant that there were no bottom
feeders around to consume the dead and dying animals.
Year after year, algae scumming the lake surface
bloomed and died, and so layers of fine clay and dead
micro-organisms drifted to the bottom. Each layer was
as thick as a strand of hair. It took 250 years to build up
an inch of mud. Over millions and millions of years,
plants and animals were preserved like flowers pressed
between the pages of a book, and algae and the other 
organic matter turned into oil shale.</p>

<p>     Among the thousand of fossils that paleontolo-
gists have recovered at Messel Pit are specimens repre-
senting nearly 45 different mammal species. Those
finds are critical to understanding how warmblooded
creatures evolved. Mammals and dinosaurs appeared at
nearly the same time around 200 millions years ago. But
dinosaurs were so well suited to the environment that
they crowded out any competition. Mammals lived on
the margins, mostly tiny creatures eking out a living by
eating insects under the cover of darkness. "They just
tried to stay out of the way," says Thomas Lehmann, a
Senckenberg Research Institute paleontologist. And so
it went for nearly 150 million years.</p>

<p>     Then, in an instant, everything changed, appar-
ently when an asteroid or comet struck Earth 66 million
years ago and dramatically altered the climate, eventu-
ally wiping out the giant reptiles. The diversity of
species found among the Messel Pit fossils reveals that
mammals rushed to fill every empty ecological nook
and cranny they could find. "They really tried every-
thing-flying, jumping, running, tree-dwelling, ant-
eating," says Lehmann. "From the point of view of
evolution, Messel is a fantastic laboratory to see what
life might have given us."</p>

<p>     Might have, but in many cases didn't. Messel's
most fascinating specimens may be those species that
have no living relatives, though they look jarringly
familiar. In the visitor center, kids crowd around to
watch as a conservator armed with toothbrushes, dental
picks and scalpels cleans layers of oil shale away from
a fossil unearthed just a few weeks earlier. To me, the
skeleton of <em>Ailuravus macrurus</em> looks like that of a
giant squirrel. It's three feet long, including its bushy
tail. Near the ribs a black stain traces the creature's fos-
silized digestive tract. Despite its tail, <em>Ailuravus</em> is no
squirrel ancestor. It's an evolutionary dead end;
<em>Ailuravus</em> and all of its relatives died out more than
37 million years ago. Why? Maybe they fell victim to
climate changes, or a better-adapted competitor, or dis-
appearing food sources, or simple bad luck.</p>

<p>     <em>Ailuravus'</em> resemblance to a modern squirrel is an
example of evolutionary convergence. Given enough
time, adaptations may lead to nearly identical solu-
tions-bushy tails, say, or powerful, kangaroo-like hind
legs-popping up in different species. "It's like using
the same interlocking toy bricks to build different
forms," says Lehmann.</p>

<p>     And there are forms aplenty at the Messel Pit. The
exquisitely preserved fossils have provided paleontolo-
gists with unprecedented insights into the adaptive
strategies-some successful, others not-adopted by
mammals for feeding, movement and even reproduc-
tion. For instance, the contents of the tiny prehistoric
horse's stomach-fossilized leaves and grape seeds-
indicate that the animal was not a grazer but a browser,
eating what it found on the forest floor. The paleontolo-
gists also found eight fossilized specimens of pregnant
mares, each carrying a single foal. That discovery sug-
gests that the early horses had already adopted herd
behavior, since joint care would be the best way to
guarantee the survival of small numbers of offspring.</p>
